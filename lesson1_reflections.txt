Typing some crap here because I'm testing out version control.
I was able to easily see differences in a file using a good diff tool.
This makes it easier to find differences in your code between versions
and track down where bugs may have been introduced into your code.
Having access to previous history could help you look through and see
the evolution of the code as it was developed. This could help you better
understand the architecture of the system and how it was built up. This may
also give you insight into limitqtions of the system or design decisions that
may help you better understand how bugs got introduced or how to avoid bugs
you may introduce.
